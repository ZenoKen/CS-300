# CS-300
Creating an application for a university was the main focus of the projects in this course. The functionality varied depending on the project, but the fundamental concepts remained the same: import data from a file, separate and organize it into a data structure, and execute various operations on the data structure, including sorting, printing, inserting, and deleting it. I approached these projects from the user's point of view, frequently concentrating on the layout of the user interface and organizing the various functionalities to carry out the anticipated tasks. I would then focus on input validation after that. I would attempt to break my project during runtime to find any missed flaws. Then, I would strengthen each function's rationale. I would return after each procedure to ensure the other features were still operational. I would repeat this procedure until the project's requirements were met. The greatest challenge I faced with these exercises was the gap between them and the readings for the class. I frequently thought I was being assessed on material that wasn't being taught. The projects occasionally requested information that was never delivered, and other times required information from modules that had not yet been covered. With outside sources, I had to spend an unreasonable amount of time. Although I know, I will need this talent in the future. I still hope to gain knowledge from the course as a student paying for an education. As a result, I don't think this class has improved my ability to write code or broadened my perspective on how to build software and create programs.
